# Configuration file for pacpush.
#
# The default configuration file exists at
# /usr/share/pacpush/pacpush.conf but a user can create a personal
# custom configuration file at ~/.config/pacpush/pacpush.conf.
#
# Lines starting with '#' and blank lines are ignored.

# clonedir specifies the clone dir where your AUR helper downloads the
# AUR files. Pacpush will look for and sync packages under this dir.
# Change the clonedir setting to match the dir your AUR helper uses. Or
# comment/delete it if your do not require AUR sync. It is best to set
# clonedir to a permanent dir, e.g. in ~/.cache/ and not in /tmp. Be
# sure to clean the dir occasionally (e.g. yay -Scaq --noconfirm).
# This can also be set to a list of directories, see default below.

# Example Yay configuration. Must be set to match your "buildDir"
# setting in ~/.config/yay/config.json.
# clonedir: ~/.cache/yay

# Example Trizen configuration. Must be set to match your "clone_dir"
# setting in ~/.config/trizen/trizen.conf.
# clonedir: ~/.cache/trizen

# Default configuration is to sync all/any of the above directories
# (which exist) and some others. E.g. If you were using trizen some time
# ago, and am now using yay instead, then keep this default setting and
# just do a "rm -rf ~/.cache/trizen". Pacpush ignores clonedir
# directories which don't exist. Pacpush will sync packages in each
# clonedir which do exist and are pending an update.
clonedir: [~/.cache/yay, ~/.cache/paru/clone, ~/.cache/trizen,
    ~/.cache/pikaur/aur_repos, ~/.cache/aurman]

# Specify an explicit ssh_config file to use. If this is a relative path
# then it is considered relative to the path of this configuration file.
# Alternately, this can be specified (or overridden) via command line.
# ssh_config_file: ~/.ssh/config-pacpush

# Specify that mirrorlist file be synced. This can be specified
# on command line also. Default is no.
# mirrorlist: no
